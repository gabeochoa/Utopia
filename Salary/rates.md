# Rules

1. all salaries are generated through a function
2. it follows that anyone's base would then be calculable and open
3. because salary is not deterministic, bonus is used to make up for any base-calculation discrepencies
  - salary is not to be used as a way to hide numbers from employees
  - salary must be a percentage (max 30%) of base
  
# Notes 

Many companies try to stop workers from discussing pay. "(In the United States, this kind of rule is unenforceable, by the way, but some bosses hope their workers won't know that.) The trouble with keeping salaries a secret is that it's usually used as a way to avoid paying people fairly."

FCS: (http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/ladder.html)
  - each employee is a assigned a level from 8(intern) to 16(CEO)
  - level is calculated based on experience, scope of responsibility, and skill set
  - you make the same as every other employee at that level
  
  Experience - number of years of full time experience (not school/unrelated jobs - sorry phd's)
  Scope - How many people are below you? How much are you responsible for? etc
  Skill - check link^

  - Every year managers recalculate levels
  - profit sharing for bonuses
  - using the new levels and data from salary.com and glassdoor decide new numbers
  - salary fudgeing is solved by offering a higher first year bonus (guaranteed)
  - "If you hear a lot of complaints about salaries, I suspect ... Your employees aren't deriving enough personal satisfaction from their work"
