# Rules

#### "Fair means no games." Period.

1. all salaries are generated by an equation
    - it follows that anyone's base would then be calculable and open
2. because salary is not deterministic, bonus is used to make up for any base-calculation discrepencies
  - bonus is not to be used as a way to hide numbers from employees
  - bonus must be a percentage (max 30%) of base



# Notes 

Many companies try to stop workers from discussing pay. "(In the United States, this kind of rule is unenforceable, by the way, but some bosses hope their workers won't know that.) The trouble with keeping salaries a secret is that it's usually used as a way to avoid paying people fairly."

FCS: (http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/ladder.html)
  - each employee is a assigned a level from 8(intern) to 16(CEO)
  - level is calculated based on experience, scope of responsibility, and skill set
  - you make the same as every other employee at that level
  
  Experience - number of years of full time experience (not school/unrelated jobs - sorry phd's)
  
  Scope - How many people are below you? How much are you responsible for? etc
  
  Skill - check link^

  - Every year managers recalculate levels
  - profit sharing for bonuses
  - using the new levels and data from salary.com and glassdoor decide new numbers
  - salary fudgeing is solved by offering a higher first year bonus (guaranteed)
  - "If you hear a lot of complaints about salaries, I suspect ... Your employees aren't deriving enough personal satisfaction from their work"

  - "Fair means no games." Period. 
  - based on:
    1. Skills: how good you are at what you do
      - re-evaluated every summer by your direct manager (see chart^^)
    2. Scope: how much stuff you’re responsible for
      - Newbie (told what to do), Contributor (knows what to do), Architect (designs what to do)
    3. Experience: how long you’ve been a programmer
      - group by 5 year chunks
      - time spent doing nonprogramming jobs doesnt count
      - time in college (ie internships/coop) doesnt count
    4. Company size: small companies tend to pay less than large
      - look at companies with similar number of employees
    5. Location: every geography has its own market salary
      - Locations all get paid the same, but with exceptions (NY/SV/Lon paid a little more)
        - this is done to avoid encouraging people to move out into the middle of nowhere to bank money
    6. Public artifacts: how much you work in public and how well known you are inb the community
      - Participating in SO/Stack Exchange sites
      - Contributing to open source
      - attending conferences (speaking, participating, going)
      - podcasting (tech)
      - attending hackathons or dev meetups
  
 Gitlab: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/global-compensation-calculator/#compensation-calculator
 - Calculate compensation for 200+ metro regions all over the world.
 - Based on a simple formula.
 - Based on publicly available data.
 - That is as accurate as possible given the other constrains.

`Your compensation = NYC benchmark x (0.25 + Rent Index + Hot Market Adjustment) x Level Factor x Experience Factor x Contract Type Factor`
