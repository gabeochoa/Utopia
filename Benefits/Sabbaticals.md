# Sabbatical 

There are a couple different types for people to try new things

Every three years, employees in good standing earn a 3 month long sabbatical. 

If an employee takes a paid travel/education sabbatical and leaves (the company) within 6 months, 
they will be required to pay back a prorated amount of what they were paid. 

## Internship

Employees who are willing can work as an intern in another team. 

This will allow people to get a broader knowledge of the company and a little break from their team. 

## Travel / Education

Employees are given 3 months to travel or attend school as they see fit without worry of losing pay/other benefits.

If they would like to take their sabbatical as unpaid, they can take leave up to 6 months

## Project Based

#TODO how to do this with safety for both company and employee?
