# Sick
  - Unlimited days off for sick
  - Contact your Manager or TL either the morning of or the day before as a courtesy 
  - If you are absent for more than three consecutive working days, you must provide a physician's note
  
##### Notes
  - not having unlimited means people will use vacation days when they run out, or come to work when sick
  - having unlimited means people might use it when vacation days run out
  

# Work From Home

  - Working in the office but not at your own desk is not WFH :)
  - Working at another office is not WFH
  - WFH is guaranteed for at least 8 days a month, from there its up to team dynamic
  - No cap on how many days you can WFH
  - You must still phone into any meetings when working from home
    - it might be best to wfh on days when there are less meetings 
  
##### Notes
  
  - Facebook: WFH wednesdays
  - Yahoo: Got rid of WFH policy, "engagement is up, launches have increased, and agile teams are thriving"
