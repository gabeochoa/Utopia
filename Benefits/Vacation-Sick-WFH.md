# Vacation

Following Bloomberg vacation policy for now, seems like a good middle ground

Years spent at company | Number of days
--- | --- 
0 - 9 years | 20 days
10-19 years | 23 days
20+ years   | 25 days

# Sick
  - Unlimited days off for sick
  - Contact your Manager or TL either the morning of or the day before as a courtesy 
  - If you are absent for more than three consecutive working days, you must provide a physician's note

  
# Work From Home

  - Working in the office but not at your own desk is not WFH :)
  - Working at another office is not WFH
  - WFH is guaranteed for at least 8 days a month, from there its up to team dynamic
  - No official cap on how many days you can WFH
  - You must still phone into any meetings when working from home
    - it might be best to wfh on days when there are less meetings
