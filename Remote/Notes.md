The issue comes when people think that even though they dont live in a high COL area they should get paid the same.
There are two solutions to this:

1. Pay low COL workers the same as the high COL workers
  - Match hCOL
    - this effectively 'wastes' money and this is a business so that matters
    - If someone works in NY and then moves to low COL, does their salary change?
  - Match lCOL
    - saves money on hCOL workers
    - people who live in hCOL areas are less likely to accept an offer, since its no longer competative 

2. Give high COL workers a 'bump' to make the relative base the same
  - This is nice and competative for hCOL but makes people in lCOL think that they could be 
    better off at a company that doesnt bump
    *if money is the only thing making them stay, then they can feel free to leave*

> Salary/Benefits

The short version is it's mostly fixed to Chicago rates. We do have a fixed bump for folks in SF/NYC. It's an imperfect but simple way to handle this.
Payroll and benefits are solved using a service like TriNet.

> Do you hire and pay the 60th percentile at approx. local market rates? Do you hire the best remote people at SFBay market rates?

The business owner in me says start low and raise your rates until you get the talent you're happy with. 
I would offer uniform base pay as typically lower costs of living come with other tradeoffs. 
If someone wants to make that work let them (but make it clear that it's their responsibility to make sure 
the electricity and internet are flowing when it's time to get to work)

> How is payroll and benefits handled?

I would suggest doing it like the oil companies, you setup a company and banking in the caribbean somewhere, 
and then pay folks salary into bank accounts there for them as well. Make it their problem to move/repatriate money.
Don't withhold any taxes and factor in a fixed rate for any bennies you want to offer 
(unless legally prohibited in specific jurisdictions of course, IANAL). Let them optimize the money. 
I know this is how big oil companies pay most of their workers who are on rigs in various locales in the world 
(and not just offshore!).
