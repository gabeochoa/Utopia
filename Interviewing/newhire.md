If the person is a new hire (college/junior dev):


Two tracks:

1. project track
- first round:
    - give a simple (1-2day) project and see what they come up with
    - assign any dev to look at the project and decide fate
- second round: 
    - two weeks long
    - choose a project (a task that is independant) and a senior dev
    - both the senior and intervewee will work on the project 
        - one hour of interview setting up work and environment
        - will assign some tasks for interviewee to do
        - will scrum wednesday's
        - final code review friday for an hour 
        - if super yes --> onsite
        - if eh yes    --> third
        - if no        --> fail
- third round:
    - adding more features to the project from the last interview

2. interview route
- phone interview:
    - int will be asked basic data structure questions (ask for impl)
    - they should come out of the interview thinking it was easy
        - if they cant do impl --> fail
        - if they struggled    --> second phone (same as round one)
        - if it seemed easy    --> third phone
- third phone:
    - asked question from leetcode/hackerrank etc
    - if passes -> onsite


###Onsite

1. onsite
- before onsite:
    - do a group of candidates all at once 
        - ie. every monday is a possible interview day
        - any devs who are training will be ready to be called in
    - group candidates by school
    - have a dev machine ready
    - ask them what their favorite dev setup is and try to accomodate
- first half (since we asked ^, we have to do the programming part first)
    - 9am 
        - give them something to program 
    - anyone else interviewing can be in the same room working
    - each person has a different project
    - project should be 8 hours of work with priorities (16 deliverables)
        - ie. person must finish 8 deliverables to not fail 
        - project **must** have been completed by the interviewer
    - 11am 
        - dev will go over and code review on design decisions
        - dev will go over their own codebase with differences
        - if time is left, candidate can ask questions
            - otherwise head to lunch
- lunch (12-1)
    - bring all the interviewees for the day to lunch
    - dont monitor them, just let them eat and talk to other candidates
    - when people finish eating they can go to auditorium
        - ask devs any questions

- second half (1-3)
    - two interviews in basic whiteboard fashion
    - 
- decision (4-6)
    - everyone must enter any notes they have into the system
