### interview route
- phone interview:

    - they should come out of the interview thinking it was easy
        - if they cant do impl --> fail

###Onsite

1. onsite
- before onsite:
    - do a group of candidates all at once 
        - ie. every monday is a possible interview day
        - any devs who are training will be ready to be called in
    - group candidates by school
    - have a dev machine ready
    - ask them what their favorite dev setup is and try to accomodate
- first half (since we asked ^, we have to do the programming part first)
    - 9am 
        - give them something to program 
    - anyone else interviewing can be in the same room working
    - each person has a different project
    - project should be 8 hours of work with priorities (16 deliverables)
        - ie. person must finish 8 deliverables to not fail 
        - project **must** have been completed by the interviewer
    - 11am 
        - dev will go over and code review on design decisions
        - dev will go over their own codebase with differences
        - if time is left, candidate can ask questions
            - otherwise head to lunch
- lunch (12-1)
    - bring all the interviewees for the day to lunch
    - dont monitor them, just let them eat and talk to other candidates
    - when people finish eating they can go to auditorium
        - ask devs any questions

- second half (1-3)
    - two interviews in basic whiteboard fashion
    
- decision (4-6)
